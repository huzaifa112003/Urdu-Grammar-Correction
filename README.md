# Urdu Grammar Correction using Deep Learning

This project aims to build an Urdu grammar correction model using the `google/mt5-large` model, a multilingual text-to-text transfer transformer. This repository contains code for dataset creation/scraping for the low-resource language Urdu, as well as code for training and testing the `google/mt5-large` model on the generated datasets. Additionally, the datasets that we scraped/generated are included. This is the first-of-its-kind Urdu grammar correction model using deep learning. Given the scarcity of resources for the Urdu language, we also created a custom Urdu dataset from scratch. The datasets that we scraped/generated are also included

You can check out live demo of the model here: https://qawaid.vercel.app
